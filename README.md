## Limitations
- Number of tweets collected. Anything > 5000 takes a significant time to process. 
- Only tweets in English were analysed this is because only one language at a time can be processed. There might be a tweepy functionality that supports multiple languages in a query but I could not find it. 
- Still a lot of cleaning of the data needs to be done like removing Retweets and multiple occurrances of the same tweet (maybe a bot produced these).
